
2.05.0
------------------------------------------------------------

* Default to IMMIX based internal garbage collection.
* Reorginised files - split big ones, and moved common ones out of "runtime".
* Put internal classes in "hx" namespace, or HX_ prefix for macros.
* Remove multiple-inheritance, and use delegation instead.
* Write "Options.txt" from compiler so dependency can be determined.
* Require -D HXCPP_MULTI_THREADED for multi-threaded classes - to avoid overhead if not required.
* Build thread code into executable for better control.
* Fix return values of parseINt/parseFloat.
* Added comprehensive list of reserved member names.
* Put if/else statements in blocks.
* Added assert, NULL, LITTLE_ENDIAN, BIG_ENDIAN as keywords.
* Added control over how fast-cffi routines are created by requiring cpp.rtti.FastIntergerLookup to be "implemented".
* Construct anonymous object fields in deterministic (as declared) order.
* Fix code generation for some complex inline cases.
* Added cpp.zip.Compress
* Change "Reflect" class to be more standard
* Use array of dynamics for StringBuf.
* Fix setting of attributes in XML nodes.

Build-tool:
* Allow multiple build threads (via setenv HXCPP_COMNPILE_THREADS N) for faster building on multi-code boxes.
* Added FileGroup dependencies
* Added pre-compiled headers (windows only, at the moment since gcc seems buggy)
